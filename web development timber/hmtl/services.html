            Eucalyptus refers to a genus that has more than 700 species of flowering trees and shrubs. Their barks can range from fibrous, smooth, and hard to stringy. The leaves have oil glands, and their sepals and petals are fused to form a cap over the stamens.It
            has a woody capsule fruit that is usually called a gum nut. Most eucalyptus trees originated from Australia but are now grown all over the world in plantations. Their timber is precious, but the tree can be used for many other things.For example,
            it is used in essential oils, pulpwood, and honey production.

        <p>
            Pines are evergreen regardless of climatic conditions. They are also coniferous resinous, meaning they produce resin, a highly viscous substance that can be converted into polymers.The tree can grow up to a height of about 80 meters, but most of its species
            reach between 15 and 45 m tall. One of the advantages of pines is that they are long-lived and can reach ages of between 100 and 1000 years or even longer.The 'Methuselah' pine, for instance, is about 4,600 years old and is believed to be
            one of the oldest living organisms.

        <h2>3. Bamboo</h2>

        <p>
            Bamboos happen to be among the fastest-growing plants globally because they are dependent on a unique rhizome system. The term bamboo refers to a diverse group of evergreen plants that flower perennially. They belong to the subfamily Bambusoideae of the
            grass family Poaceae. Like other grasses, the intermodal regions of bamboo are hollow, and then the vascular bundles in the cross-section are distributed throughout the stem. The flowering plant does not have dicotyledonous woody xylem. As
            a result, giant bamboos are usually columnar as opposed to tapering. Some bamboo species can grow by 910 mm in a day which is 1mm for every 90 seconds. Since they can grow rapidly even in marginal lands, they are a prime candidate for afforestation
            and carbon sequestration and other climate change mitigation strategies. Bamboo is widely used in Kenya for construction, especially in the hospitality and tourism industry. However, they also have an array of other uses, such as fencing,
            music instruments, and toothpicks. In addition, soft bamboo shoots, leaves, and stems can be used as food for mountain gorillas, chimpanzees, and gorillas.

        <p>
            UGC Jacaranda is one of the most common tree species in Kenya partly due to its landscaping benefits. The tree is thought to have originated from South America and then spread across the world, Kenya included. What makes it a good landscaping tree is
            its closely clustered light lavender-blue or purple leaves. It is planted in homesteads not only for aesthetics but also because it has a good shade. In addition, some people grow the tree for its medicinal benefits. The tree is versatile
            and can be grown in highlands, grasslands, river banks or even swampy areas. The tree is categorized as an invasive species because it forms a thicket of seedlings at its base. These seedlings, if let to grow, end up displacing other plants
            around them. They, therefore, demand a lot of attention in weeding to control their growth. The best way to grow them is through cuttings grafted from seedlings, as they take only three years to mature. Read more:
